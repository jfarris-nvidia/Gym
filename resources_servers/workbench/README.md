# Description

1. Environment: This is a tool use - multi step agentic environment that tests the agents ability to execute tasks in a workplace setting. Workbench contains a sandbox environment with five databases, 26 tools, and 690 tasks. These tasks represent common business activities, such as sending emails and scheduling meetings.
2. Domain: Business activities
3. Source of prompts: 
- Full set of prompts (1260): https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nexusflow/250319-workbench-fulleval/viewer/default/train?row=0
4. Example prompt: Reply to carlos's last email about 'Task Update on Develop prototype for report generation' with 'Thanks for the update - I will get back to you tomorrow.'
5. Verifier: The verifier accuracy is checked by running the same benchmark on the corresponding already implemented Workbench environment in (VERL)[https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/nexus-team/verl/-/blob/jk/reasoning-adherence-wip/verl/third_party/environments/workbench/workben_env.py?ref_type=heads]. 
6. Legal Approval Status: TBD
