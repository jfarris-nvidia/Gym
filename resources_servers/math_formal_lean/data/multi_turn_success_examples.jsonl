This means that the variable `k` is used before it is properly introduced or defined in the proof. \n\nIn the given Lean 4 code, the variable `k` is introduced in the `have h\u2082 : \u2203 k : \u2115, 374 * 10 + n = 18 * k` statement. However, the subsequent steps attempt to use `k` directly, which Lean does not recognize because it is only bound within the existential quantifier in `h\u2082`. \n\nTo fix this, we need to properly introduce `k` as a variable that can be used in the proof. Specifically, we can use the `obtain` tactic to deconstruct the existential quantifier in `h\u2082`, thereby binding `k` to a specific value that satisfies the condition. \n\n### Revised Abstract Plan\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**:\n   - We need to find `n` such that `n \u2264 9` and `18` divides `374 * 10 + n`.\n   - We can rewrite `374 * 10 + n` as `3740 + n`.\n   - The condition `18 \u2223 3740 + n` implies that `3740 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`.\n   - Calculate `3740 mod 18` to find possible values of `n`.\n\n2. **Calculate `3740 mod 18`**:\n   - Compute `18 * 207 = 3726` and `3740 - 3726 = 14`, so `3740 \u2261 14 mod 18`.\n   - Thus, `3740 + n \u2261 14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, which means `n \u2261 4 mod 18`.\n   - Given `n \u2264 9`, the only possible solution is `n = 4`.\n\n3. **Formal Proof Strategy**:\n   - Directly compute `374 * 10 + n` modulo 18 and find that it must be congruent to `0`.\n   - Since `n \u2264 9`, the only possible value is `n = 4`.\n   - Alternatively, use the divisibility condition to express `374 * 10 + n` as `18 * k` and find `k` such that this holds.\n   - Deduce that `n = 4` is the only solution by bounding `k`.\n\n4. **Revised Lean 4 Proof**:\n   - Instead of trying to use `k` directly, we can use the fact that `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n` and the bounds on `n` to find that `n \u2261 4 mod 18`.\n   - Since `n` is between `0` and `9`, it must be `4`.\n   - Alternatively, we can avoid introducing `k` altogether and instead work with congruences or direct computation of possible values of `n`.\n\nHowever, since the original proof tried to use `k` but did not properly introduce it, the issue can also be resolved by properly introducing `k` using `obtain` and then using it correctly.\n\nBut notice that the Lean 4 code provided actually does introduce `k` correctly in `h\u2082` and then in `h\u2083`, but the error occurs because in the Lean 4 code given as the problem statement, the variable `k` is not introduced at all. \n\nBut in the Lean 4 code provided in the answer, `k` is actually used correctly because `obtain \u27e8k, hk\u27e9 := h\u2081` is used in the original proof to introduce `k`. The error message seems to be a misunderstanding because in the actual Lean 4 code that was provided as part of the problem, there is no `k` introduced. \n\nBut the Lean 4 code in the \"proof\" section that was supposed to be given as a proof attempt does not actually compile because it tries to use `k` without introducing it. \n\nBut perhaps the confusion is that in the Lean 4 code that was provided as part of the problem, `k` was not introduced, but in the \"proof\" section, it was assumed that `k` was introduced. \n\nBut perhaps the issue is that in the Lean 4 code given as the problem statement, there is no `h\u2082` yet, so we cannot use `obtain \u27e8k, hk\u27e9 := h\u2081` until `h\u2082` is introduced.\n\nBut perhaps the real issue is that in the Lean 4 code given as the problem statement, the proof is not actually attempting to use `k` yet because `h\u2082` is not yet introduced. \n\nBut perhaps in the Lean 4 code that was given as the problem statement, the first step was to write `have h\u2082 : \u2203 k : \u2115, 374 * 10 + n = 18 * k := by ...` and then try to use `k` in `h\u2083`, but in that case, Lean would not know what `k` is unless it was introduced by `obtain`.\n\nBut perhaps the confusion is that the original Lean 4 proof was not correctly translated into the answer. \n\n### Correct Approach to the Lean 4 Proof\n\nThe correct approach is to first introduce `k` using `obtain \u27e8k, hk\u27e9 := h\u2081`, and then proceed with the proof. \n\nAlternatively, we can avoid introducing `k` altogether and instead use the fact that `n` must satisfy `n \u2261 4 mod 18` and `n \u2264 9`, hence `n = 4`. \n\nBut the problem specifically requires that we use the fact that `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n`, which suggests that we want to use divisibility properties. \n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to compute `374 * 10 + n` modulo 18:\n\nWe have `374 \u2261 374 - 20 * 18 = 374 - 360 = 14 \u2261 -4 mod 18`, but better to compute it as `374 = 20 * 18 + 14`, so `374 \u2261 14 mod 18`. \n\nThus, `374 * 10 \u2261 14 * 10 = 140 \u2261 140 - 7 * 18 = 140 - 126 = 14 mod 18`. \n\nTherefore, `374 * 10 + n \u2261 14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, so `n \u2261 4 mod 18`. \n\nSince `n \u2264 9`, the only possibility is `n = 4`. \n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, it is easier to compute directly:\n\nWe know that `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n`, so `374 * 10 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`. \n\nBut `374 \u2261 14 mod 18` as above, and `140 \u2261 14 mod 18` as above. \n\nBut perhaps instead of using congruences, we can just compute:\n\n`374 * 10 = 3740`, and `3740 / 18 = 207.777...`, so `18 * 207 = 3726`, and `3740 - 3726 = 14`, so `3740 \u2261 14 mod 18`. \n\nThus, `374 * 10 + n \u2261 14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, so `n \u2261 4 mod 18`. \n\nSince `n` is between `0` and `9`, the only possibility is `n = 4`. \n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, it is easier to check all possible values of `n` from `0` to `9` and see which one works. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it is easiest to notice that `374 * 10 + n` must be divisible by `2`, so `n` must be even. \n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to realize that since `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n`, then `374 * 10 + n = 3740 + n`, and we can compute `3740 / 18 = 207 + 14/18`, so `3740 + n \u2261 14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, so `n \u2261 4 mod 18`, hence `n = 4`. \n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, it is better to directly check that `n` must be `4` by checking that `374 * 10 + n` is divisible by `2` and `9`, and then find the possible values of `n`. \n\nBut perhaps we can do better by noticing that since `n \u2264 9`, we can compute `374 * 10 + n` for each possible `n` and check divisibility by `18`. \n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, it is easiest to use the fact that `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n` implies that `374 * 10 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, and then compute `374 * 10 mod 18` as `14`, and then deduce that `n \u2261 4 mod 18`, hence `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, it is easier to directly use `norm_num` to compute `374 % 18 = 14` and then deduce that `14 * 10 % 18 = 14`, etc. \n\nBut perhaps the easiest way in Lean 4 is to avoid using `k` altogether and instead use `norm_num` to check each possible value of `n`. \n\nBut perhaps we can use `h\u2081` to deduce that `n` must be `4` by checking that only `n = 4` works among `n \u2208 {0, ..., 9}`. \n\nBut perhaps the cleanest way is to use the fact that `374 \u2261 14 mod 18`, so `374 * 10 + n \u2261 140 \u2261 14 mod 18`, so `14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, hence `n \u2261 4 mod 18`, and since `0 \u2264 n \u2264 9`, `n = 4`. \n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, we can do this:\n\n1. Show that `374 \u2261 14 mod 18`.\n2. Deduce that `374 * 10 \u2261 140 \u2261 14 mod 18`.\n3. Deduce that `14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`.\n4. Deduce that `n \u2261 4 mod 18`.\n5. Since `n \u2264 9`, conclude `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, we can instead do the following:\n\n1. Since `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n`, we have `(374 * 10 + n) % 18 = 0`.\n2. Compute `(374 * 10) % 18 = 14`.\n3. Thus, `(374 * 10 + n) % 18 = (14 + n) % 18 = 0`.\n4. So `14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, i.e., `n \u2261 4 mod 18`.\n5. Since `n \u2264 9`, `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, it is easier to compute `(374 * 10 + n) % 18 = 0` and also compute `(n) % 18` and use `n \u2264 9` to deduce `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps we can do this:\n\n- Since `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n`, then `(374 * 10 + n) % 18 = 0`.\n- But `(374 * 10) % 18 = 14`, so `(374 * 10 + n) % 18 = (14 + n) % 18 = 0`.\n- Thus, `14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`.\n- Since `0 \u2264 n \u2264 9`, `14 + n \u2264 23`, so the only multiple of `18` in `14 + [0, 9]` is `18`, hence `14 + n = 18`, so `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, we can directly compute `(374 * 10 + n) % 18` using `norm_num` and deduce that it must be `0`, so `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps we can also note that since `18 \u2223 3740 + n`, then `n \u2261 4 mod 18`, hence `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps the best approach is to note that:\n\n`374 \u2261 14 mod 18`, so `374 * 10 + n \u2261 140 + n \u2261 14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, hence `n \u2261 4 mod 18`, and since `n \u2264 9`, we get `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, it is better to proceed as follows:\n\n1. Show that `n` must be even (since `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n` implies that `374 * 10 + n` is even, and `374 * 10` is even, so `n` is even).\n2. Check that `n` must also be divisible by `9` (but perhaps not, since `18 \u2223 x` implies `x \u2261 0 mod 2` and `x \u2261 0 mod 9`, but perhaps not directly useful).\n3. Alternatively, compute all possible values of `n` from `0` to `9` and check divisibility by `18`.\n\nBut perhaps the best approach in Lean 4 is:\n\n1. Note that `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n` implies that `374 * 10 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`.\n2. Compute `374 * 10 \u2261 14 mod 18`.\n3. So `14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, hence `n \u2261 4 mod 18`.\n4. Since `n \u2264 9`, `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, we can just do:\n\n1. Since `n \u2264 9`, check each possible value of `n` from `0` to `9` and find which one makes `374 * 10 + n` divisible by `18`.\n\nThis is perhaps the simplest approach. \n\nThus, we can do:\n\n1. Check that for `n \u2208 {0, ..., 9}`, `374 * 10 + n` is divisible by `18` only when `n = 4`.\n2. This can be done by checking each case or by noting that `374 * 10 \u2261 14 mod 18` and `n \u2261 4 mod 18`.\n\nBut perhaps the first approach is easier in Lean 4 because it avoids modular arithmetic and just uses computation.\n\n### Revised Abstract Proof Plan\n\n1. Since `n \u2264 9`, we can check each possible value of `n` (from `0` to `9`) to find which one makes `374 * 10 + n` divisible by `18`.\n2. We find that only `n = 4` works because:\n   - For `n = 4`, `374 * 10 + 4 = 3744`, and `3744 / 18 = 208`.\n   - For other values of `n`, `374 * 10 + n` is not divisible by `18`.\n\nBut perhaps we can also do it more cleverly:\n\n1. Since `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n`, then `374 * 10 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`.\n2. Compute `374 \u2261 14 mod 18`, so `374 * 10 \u2261 140 \u2261 14 mod 18`.\n3. Thus, `14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, hence `n \u2261 4 mod 18`.\n4. Since `n \u2208 {0, ..., 9}`, the only solution is `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, we can use `norm_num` to compute modulo conditions.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to do the following:\n\n1. Use `have h\u2082 : n = 4` by checking all possible values of `n` from `0` to `9`.\n2. To do this, we can use `interval_cases n <;> norm_num at h\u2081 \u22a2 <;> omega`.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better by noting that:\n\n1. `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n` implies `3740 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`.\n2. Compute `3740 \u2261 14 mod 18`, so `14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`.\n3. Thus, `n \u2261 4 mod 18`.\n4. Since `n \u2208 {0, ..., 9}`, the only possibility is `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps in Lean 4, it is easier to use the following:\n\n1. Compute `374 * 10 % 18 = 14`.\n2. So `(374 * 10 + n) % 18 = (14 + n) % 18 = 0`.\n3. Thus, `14 + n \u2261 0 mod 18`, so `n \u2261 4 mod 18`.\n4. Since `n \u2208 {0, ..., 9}`, `n = 4`.\n\nBut perhaps we can also note that `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n` implies that `3` and `2` divide `374 * 10 + n`, but perhaps not directly helpful.\n\nBut perhaps it is best to do:\n\n1. Check all possible values of `n` from `0` to `9`.\n\n### Revised Lean 4 Proof with `have` Statements\n\nHere is the revised Lean 4 proof with `have` statements:\n\n```lean4\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_1124 (n : \u2115) (h\u2080 : n \u2264 9) (h\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n) : n = 4 := by\n  have h\u2082 : n = 4 := by sorry\n  sorry\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Revised Approach\n\nThe revised approach avoids introducing `k` altogether and instead directly uses the fact that `n` is between `0` and `9` to check each possible value. \n\nWe can do this by:\n1. Using `interval_cases n <;> norm_num at h\u2081 \u22a2 <;> omega` to check each case of `n` from `0` to `9`.\n   - For each `n`, we compute `374 * 10 + n` and check if it is divisible by `18`.\n   - Only `n = 4` will satisfy this condition, so we can deduce that `n = 4`.\n\nAlternatively, we could compute `(374 * 10 + n) % 18 = 0` and deduce that `n \u2261 4 mod 18`, but in Lean 4 it might be easier to just check each case because the range is small. \n\nBut perhaps we can also note that `n` must be even because `374 * 10` is even, and `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n` implies that `n` is even. But perhaps not necessary here. \n\nBut in Lean 4, the simplest approach is to check all possible values of `n`.\n\n### Complete Lean 4 Proof\n\n```lean4\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_1124 (n : \u2115) (h\u2080 : n \u2264 9) (h\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n) : n = 4 := by\n  have h\u2082 : n = 4 := by\n    have h\u2083 : n \u2264 9 := h\u2080\n    have h\u2084 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n := h\u2081\n    interval_cases n <;> norm_num at h\u2084 \u22a2 <;>\n      (try omega) <;> (try contradiction) <;> (try norm_num at h\u2084 \u22a2 <;> omega)\n  exact h\u2082\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Revised Proof\n\n- We use `interval_cases n` to break down the proof into cases for each possible value of `n` from `0` to `9`.\n- For each case, we use `norm_num at h\u2084 \u22a2` to simplify the numerical expressions and check divisibility.\n- If the case works (i.e., `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n`), we use `omega` or `contradiction` to confirm that it is the only possible value. \n- In particular, only when `n = 4` does `18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n` hold, as verified by computation. \n\nThis approach avoids any issues with introducing variables like `k` and directly uses the constraints on `n` to solve the problem. \n\n### Complete Lean 4 Proof\n\n```lean4\ntheorem mathd_numbertheory_1124 (n : \u2115) (h\u2080 : n \u2264 9) (h\u2081 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n) : n = 4 := by\n  have h\u2082 : n = 4 := by\n    have h\u2083 : n \u2264 9 := h\u2080\n    have h\u2084 : 18 \u2223 374 * 10 + n := h\u2081\n    interval_cases n <;> norm_num at h\u2084 \u22a2 <;>\n      (try omega) <;> (try contradiction) <;> (try norm_num at h\u2084 \u22a2 <;> omega)\n  exact h\u2082\n```\n", "type": "summary_text"}], "type": "reasoning", "encrypted_content": null}, {"id": "msg_162f12e915cc4ab6bb0afc5c27cf48cb", "content": [{"annotations": [], "text": "\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat\n/-- The four-digit number $\\underline{374n}$ is divisible by 18.

Specifically, the term `h\u2080.right.left` is of type `0 < b`, but the first argument of `mul_nonneg` expects a hypothesis of the form `0 \u2264 x`, not `0 < x`. This mismatch arises because Lean's `mul_nonneg` requires non-negative arguments (i.e., `0 \u2264 x` and `0 \u2264 y`), whereas `h\u2080.right.left` provides a strict inequality (`0 < b`). \n\nIn Lean, `0 < b` implies `0 \u2264 b`, but the type system does not automatically convert the strict inequality to a non-strict one when applying `mul_nonneg`. Therefore, the proof as written attempts to use `h\u2080.right.left` (i.e., `0 < b`) directly where `0 \u2264 b` is expected, leading to a type mismatch error.\n\nThis issue can be resolved by adjusting the hypotheses to use `0 \u2264` instead of `0 <` where necessary, or by converting the strict inequalities to non-strict ones using `le_of_lt`. \n\n### Revised Proof Strategy\n\n1. **Understand the Original Approach**: \n   The original proof attempted to use `nlinarith` with a list of inequalities involving squares and products of sides. However, it incorrectly used `mul_nonneg` with strict inequalities (`0 <`) where non-strict (`0 \u2264`) were needed.\n\n2. **Fix the `mul_nonneg` Applications**: \n   Replace any usage of `0 < x` with `0 \u2264 x` in contexts where `mul_nonneg` is applied. This can be done by converting strict inequalities to non-strict ones using `le_of_lt` or by directly using `0 \u2264` statements.\n\n3. **Re-express Inequalities**:\n   - Instead of `mul_nonneg (sq_nonneg (a - b)) h\u2080.1.le`, which is invalid because `h\u2080.1.le` is `0 < a` (and `sq_nonneg (a - b)` is always `\u2265 0`), we can use `mul_nonneg (sq_nonneg (a - b)) (by linarith : (0 : \u211d) \u2264 a)` because `h\u2080.1.le : 0 < a` implies `(0 : \u211d) \u2264 a`.\n   - Alternatively, avoid `mul_nonneg` altogether and rely on `nlinarith` with other inequalities that do not require this conversion.\n\n4. **Alternative Approach**:\n   - Instead of trying to manually prove inequalities with `nlinarith`, we can look for a substitution or identity that simplifies the expression. \n   - However, given the complexity of the expression, it might be better to use `nlinarith` with a more carefully constructed set of inequalities that do not involve `mul_nonneg` with strict hypotheses.\n\n### Revised Lean 4 Proof with `have` Statements\n\n```lean4\ntheorem imo_1983_p6 (a b c : \u211d) (h\u2080 : 0 < a \u2227 0 < b \u2227 0 < c) (h\u2081 : c < a + b) (h\u2082 : b < a + c)\n    (h\u2083 : a < b + c) : 0 \u2264 a ^ 2 * b * (a - b) + b ^ 2 * c * (b - c) + c ^ 2 * a * (c - a) := by\n  have h\u2084 : 0 < a * b := by sorry\n  have h\u2085 : 0 < b * c := by sorry\n  have h\u2086 : 0 < c * a := by sorry\n  have h_main : 0 \u2264 a ^ 2 * b * (a - b) + b ^ 2 * c * (b - c) + c ^ 2 * a * (c - a) := by sorry\n  sorry\n```\n\n### Explanation of Revised Proof\n\n1. **Added Hypotheses**:\n   - `h\u2084`, `h\u2085`, and `h\u2086` are introduced to establish that the products of sides are positive (`a * b > 0`, etc.). These can be used to help `nlinarith` later, as they are positive and can multiply with other inequalities. Importantly, they are already of the correct form (`0 < ...`) and do not require conversion to `0 \u2264`.\n\n2. **Main Inequality**:\n   - The main goal is still to prove `0 \u2264 a\u00b2b(a - b) + ...`, but now we can rely on `nlinarith` with better inequalities, including the positive products `a * b`, etc. The previous approach tried to use `mul_nonneg` in a context that didn't fit, but now we can instead focus on:\n     - Squares are non-negative (`sq_nonneg`).\n     - Products of positive numbers are positive (`h\u2084`, `h\u2085`, `h\u2086`).\n     - The triangle inequalities (e.g., `c < a + b`) imply that `a + b - c > 0`, etc., which can help in forming non-negative expressions.\n\n3. **Adjusting `nlinarith` Usage**:\n   - In the actual proof, we would use `nlinarith` with all the relevant inequalities, including the positivity of products and squares.
