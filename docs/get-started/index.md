# Get Started with NeMo Gym

**Estimated Time**: 25-30 minutes

This guided tutorial experience is designed for those brand new to training models with reinforcement learning (RL). These tutorials walk you through the complete journey from installation to generating training data at scale.

**By the end of this tutorial series, you will have:**

✅ A working NeMo Gym installation with servers running  
✅ Ability to generate rollouts for RL training

## Before You Start

Make sure you have these prerequisites ready before beginning the tutorials:

- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **OpenAI API key** with available credits (requires ~$0.01-0.10 for all tutorials)
- Basic command-line familiarity
