## How to Navigate This Section

- Read these explanations when your team needs shared vocabulary for configuring Models, Resources, and Agents together.
- Pair each concept page with its related tutorials when you are ready to practice tasks such as assembling interaction datasets or scoring agent behavior.
- Return here whenever you add a new teammate so that they can orient and choose the depth that fits their role.
