## NeMo Gym Within the NeMo Framework

The [NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo) is NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated platform for training large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and speech models. It includes multiple specialized components:

* **NeMo Megatron-Bridge**: Pretraining and fine-tuning with Megatron-Core
* **NeMo AutoModel**: PyTorch native training for Hugging Face models
* **NeMo RL**: Scalable reinforcement learning toolkit
* **NeMo Gym**: RL environment infrastructure and rollout collection (this project)
* **NeMo Curator**: Data preprocessing and curation
* **NeMo Evaluator**: Model evaluation and benchmarking
* **NeMo Guardrails**: Programmable safety guardrails
* And more...

**NeMo Gym's Role**: Within this ecosystem, Gym focuses specifically on standardizing scalable rollout collection for RL training. It provides unified interfaces to heterogeneous RL environments and curated resource servers with verification logic, making it practical to generate large-scale, high-quality training data that feeds into NeMo RL and other training frameworks.
